    "text": "1 Introduction\nSince the COVID-19 outbreak, many people have died due to the disease. In order to stay safe and healthy, people may have gradually changed their mindset and hygiene habits accordingly. Owing to this potential change, we are interested in finding if there are any changes to disease casualties and other plausible factors that might also cause the changes.\nWe first started researching diseases transmitted through similar manners, influenza and pneumonia. We would like to explore whether the emergence of COVID-19 affected the prevalence of casualties in influenza or/and pneumonia before and after the COVID-19 outbreak. Specifically, we are interested in the following aspects of the questions:\n- How is the change reflected nationally over the time frame from 2019 to 2021?\n- How is the change reflected across different regions such as states? Does it have similar trends in all the states or are there any patterns in nearby states?\n- How is the change reflected across different age groups (&lt; 18, 18 ~ 64, 65 + years old)?\nAfter focusing on influenza and pneumonia, we would like to know the current prevalence of other disease casualties as a whole and individually. For instance, how are the counts of the total deaths spread out in the following categories:\n1. Natural cause\n2. Septicemia\n3. Malignant neoplasms\n4. Diabetes mellitus\n5. Alzheimer disease\n6. Influenza and pneumonia\n7. Respiratory diseases (Combine lower respiratory with other respiratory ones)\n8. Diseases of heart\n9. Cerebrovascular diseases\nWith the exploration into various diseases’ casualties, it is worthwhile to consider if national coverage of the vaccines affects disease casualties."

    "text": "2.1 Description\nTo find out whether there are any changes to disease casualties and other plausible factors that might also cause the changes, we collected several datasets from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Thanks to the easy access to the data by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the datasets are all downloadable in csv file types. Thus, we first downloaded the data and then uploaded to the data folder in the working directory of the project for convenience of data cleaning, processing and visualizing.\nData Source 1:\nThe first one is “Pneumonia and Influenza Mortality Surveillance” from National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) Mortality Surveillance System, a table of dimension 19345 by 14 when choosing state data. The data sources are collected by NCHS through State Vital Statistics Offices across the United States. The deaths which is confirmed through death certificate include multiple cause associated with influenza, pneumonia, or COVID. Because the data are collected weekly, they are updated and aggregated by weeks and will be displayed from 1 to 52 through a complete year. Note that the value total deaths include all the frequency based on ICD-10 multiple cause of death so it doesn’t equal to the sum of deaths from influenza, pneumonia and COVID-19 only.\nThe link to the data source is as follows:\nhttps://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/fluview/Mortality.html\nData Source 2:\nThe second one is “Weekly Provisional Counts of Deaths by State and Select Causes, 2020-2023” by National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), a table of dimension 10477 by 20. The data is collected by NCHS through the Vital Statistics Cooperative Program and updated as of September 27, 2023. The mortality data are based on the death certificates in all the states include counts of death by cause, week and state but they excludes the nonresidents and fetus. Notice that the provisional deaths are based on the flow of the mortality data in the National Vital Statistics System so there is a time lapse between the time deaths occur and the time to submit and eventually reflected on the system. Also, we need to be aware that the cause of the death classification is categorized by ICD-10 codes. So the total values of deaths is not equal to the sum of the listed deaths in other categories.\nThe link to the data source is as follows:\nhttps://data.cdc.gov/NCHS/Weekly-Provisional-Counts-of-Deaths-by-State-and-S/muzy-jte6\nData Source 3:\nThe final ones are “Weekly Cumulative Influenza Vaccination Coverage, Children 6 months through 18 years, United States” with dimension of 9895 by 28 and “Weekly Cumulative Influenza Vaccination Coverage, Adults 18 and Older United States” with dimension of 4836 by 22 from National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases (NCIRD). The data are updated regularly throughout the flu seasons whenever new data are available. The influenza vaccination coverage is assessed through the National Immunization Survey - Adult COVID Module (NIS-ACM) providing weekly influenza vaccination coverage estimates. Notice that the weekly influenza surveillance report is prepared by the Influenza Division so the data are subject to the changes according the the reports received.\nThe link to the data source is as follows:\n&lt; 18 years old: https://data.cdc.gov/Vaccinations/Weekly-Cumulative-Influenza-Vaccination-Coverage-C/eudc-n39h\n18 + years old: https://data.cdc.gov/Flu-Vaccinations/Weekly-Cumulative-Influenza-Vaccination-Coverage-A/2v3t-r3np"

    "text": "2.2 Research Plan\nSince all data sets are collected weekly, it is intuitive to merge the data across different sources and then group them by states or by weeks in general sense. We may clean and process data by keeping variables indicating weeks, states, ages, and deaths of influenza or/and pneumonia to demonstrate what are the changes before and after the COVID-19 outbreak. Depending on the graphs’ needs and availability of data, we could potentially extend the range of data from comparing year 2019 with year 2022 to a wider range of year such as from year 2018 to 2019 and with those from 2021 to 2023. With larger pool of the data points, it is more likely to show the effects of COVID-19 on the casualties of diseases of interest. A brief show of dataset 1 without any merging is as follows:\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(stringr)\ndf1 = read.csv('data/data1.csv')\ndf1_filter = df1 %&gt;% select('SUB.AREA','SEASON','AGE.GROUP','WEEK','NUM.INFLUENZA.DEATHS','NUM.PNEUMONIA.DEATHS','NUM.COVID.19.DEATHS','TOTAL.DEATHS')\ncolnames(df1_filter) &lt;- c('state','season','age_group','week','influenza','pneumonia','covid','total')\nhead(df1_filter)\n\n\n    state  season age_group week influenza pneumonia covid total\n1 Alabama 2023-24       All   40         0        37    18   961\n2 Alabama 2023-24       All   41         0        60    19   987\n3 Alabama 2023-24       All   42         0        43    12   927\n4 Alabama 2023-24       All   43         1        46     6   897\n5 Alabama 2023-24       All   44         1        40    16   825\n6 Alabama 2023-24       All   45         0        31    10   607\n\n\nAfter examining the trends of specific diseases, it is reasonable to apply the same logic to other diseases of interest. However, instead of comparing before and after disease outbreak individually, we are comparing horizontally across different kinds of disease to show how the total deaths spread out in different categories using heatmaps of 10 including one with total casualties as a reference while each of rest is representing a category and its death frequency. A quick overview of our dataset 2 is:\n\n\nCode\ndf2 = read.csv('data/data2.csv')\ndf2_filter = df2 %&gt;% select('MMWR.Year','MMWR.Week','All.Cause','Natural.Cause','Septicemia..A40.A41.','Malignant.neoplasms..C00.C97.','Diabetes.mellitus..E10.E14.','Alzheimer.disease..G30.','Influenza.and.pneumonia..J09.J18.','Chronic.lower.respiratory.diseases..J40.J47.','Other.diseases.of.respiratory.system..J00.J06.J30.J39.J67.J70.J98.','Nephritis..nephrotic.syndrome.and.nephrosis..N00.N07.N17.N19.N25.N27.','Symptoms..signs.and.abnormal.clinical.and.laboratory.findings..not.elsewhere.classified..R00.R99.','Diseases.of.heart..I00.I09.I11.I13.I20.I51.','Cerebrovascular.diseases..I60.I69.','COVID.19..U071..Multiple.Cause.of.Death.','COVID.19..U071..Underlying.Cause.of.Death.')\ncolnames(df2_filter) &lt;- c('year','week','all_cause','natural','septicemia','neoplasms','miabete','alzheimer','influenza/pneumonia','lower_respiratory','other_respiratory','nephritis','abnormal','heart','cerebrovascular','covid_nultiple','covid_underlying')\nhead(df2_filter)\n\n\n  year week all_cause natural septicemia neoplasms miabete alzheimer\n1 2020    1     60179   55010        843     11567    1829      2537\n2 2020    2     60735   55755        861     11963    1942      2566\n3 2020    3     59363   54516        829     11701    1819      2491\n4 2020    4     59162   54401        828     11879    1864      2517\n5 2020    5     58834   54001        811     11963    1828      2480\n6 2020    6     59491   54416        806     11704    1957      2515\n  influenza/pneumonia lower_respiratory other_respiratory nephritis abnormal\n1                1559              3501              1068      1094      630\n2                1528              3708              1035      1092      649\n3                1484              3526               992      1121      612\n4                1488              3403               979      1107      638\n5                1411              3313               981      1074      616\n6                1463              3413               975      1135      600\n  heart cerebrovascular covid_nultiple covid_underlying\n1 14204            3110              0                0\n2 13911            3189              1                1\n3 13593            3256              2                1\n4 13612            3185              3                2\n5 13465            3084              0                0\n6 14005            3056              4                3\n\n\nAlthough alert of the risks for assorted disease casualties is a good start, we still need some kinds to actions to combat or counteract with such situations. The most common solution to such challenges is through immunization. We would like to discover the correlation between vaccine coverage and deaths. According to our common sense and public education on vaccination, we would expect to have a negative relationship. However, it remains to be verified by a scatter plot of vaccination coverage versus casualties of different diseases grouped by states so we would have each point representing a state with a specific kind of disease.
