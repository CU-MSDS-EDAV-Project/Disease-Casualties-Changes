In our interactive graph section, we present data for eight distinct years. You can investigate the correlation between pneumonia and influenza fatalities by selecting a year of interest. Each point on the graph represents the aggregated death count for a particular state over the months of the chosen year. This visual representation allows for an immediate and clear understanding of the death toll relationship between these two illnesses on a state-by-state basis.
